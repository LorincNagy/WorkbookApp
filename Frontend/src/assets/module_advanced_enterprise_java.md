# Enterprise module (Java branch)

### Java Enterprise and Spring

#### What are the possible uses of reflection?

Reflection in Java allows for programmatic access to information about the fields, methods, and constructors of loaded
classes. It can be used for inspecting classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, creating new instances of
objects, invoking methods, and changing field values.

#### What is Spring?

Spring is a comprehensive framework for enterprise Java development. With a wide range of capabilities, Spring
simplifies Java development and promotes good design practices. Spring enables the creation of high-performing,
reusable, and scalable applications. It provides infrastructure support, so developers can focus on business logic.

#### What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a project that simplifies the development of applications based on the Spring framework, promoting
convention over configuration. It simplifies dependency management, configuration, and runtime environment setup, making
it easier to build stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

#### What is the major difference between the Standard edition (JSE) and Enterprise edition (JEE)? You can choose Spring (Spring Boot) instead of JavaEE. Focus on comparing them.

Java Standard Edition (JSE) is the core Java programming platform, providing APIs for basic functionalities. Java
Enterprise Edition (JavaEE), or alternatively Spring, extends JSE by providing APIs and frameworks, catering to the
needs of enterprise-scale applications. Spring Boot further simplifies Spring application development, reducing the need
for extensive configuration and setup.

#### What are the advantages of the Spring Framework? Focus on the Core part.

The Core part of Spring Framework provides fundamental parts of the framework including IoC and Dependency Injection
which promotes loose coupling, thereby making components easy to test and integrate. It also helps in managing the life
cycle of the objects, promoting design principles like SOLID and making applications more modular, maintainable, and
efficient.

#### What is a servlet? What is the purpose of DispatcherServlet in Spring?

A servlet is a Java class that handles requests, processes them, and replies with a response. In Spring,
DispatcherServlet acts as a front controller, receiving incoming requests and dispatching them to the appropriate
handlers (controllers). It plays a crucial role in Spring MVC's workflow by managing the flow of request and response.

#### When do you use RestControllers, when just simple Controllers?

Use @RestController when you are building a RESTful web service, and it is mainly used to send data in JSON or XML
format. @Controller is used when you are creating a traditional web application and want to return a view, and it is
generally used in combination with Thymeleaf or JSPs.

#### What is Spring Application Context?

The Spring Application Context is a centralized interface for configuring and managing Spring beans. It holds the
configuration and state for your application and is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling beans,
managing their lifecycle, and providing access to them as needed.

#### What are the main ways to define a bean in the Application Context?

Beans in the Application Context can be defined using annotations like @Component, XML configuration, or Java-based
configuration using @Bean annotation. These different approaches give developers flexibility and control over how beans
are defined, configured, and managed within the application.

#### Difference between .jar and .war files.

A .jar file (Java Archive) is used for packaging Java classes and associated resources, whereas a .war file (Web
Application Archive) is used specifically for packaging web applications. .war files include JSP, HTML, JavaScript, and
other resources needed for the web application in addition to Java classes.

#### What are the major differences between Maven, Ant and Gradle?

Maven, Ant, and Gradle are build automation tools. Maven uses convention over configuration and XML files for defining
builds, Ant provides procedural build scripts, and Gradle offers a powerful and flexible build system with a DSL based
on Groovy or Kotlin. Gradle combines the best features of both, allowing for convention over configuration when needed,
and flexibility for custom builds.

#### What is Maven used for?

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool, primarily used for managing project's build lifecycle and
dependencies. It simplifies the build process by providing a standard build lifecycle and dependency management,
allowing developers to focus more on writing code.

#### What does a pom.xml file contains in Maven?

The pom.xml file in Maven contains project information, configuration details, plugin management, and dependency lists,
defining how the project is built, its dependencies, and other crucial aspects like goals and phases.

### Object Relational Mapping, JPA, Hibernate

#### What is an ORM? What are the benefits, when to use?

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that enables interaction with the database, like querying or updating,
using Object-Oriented Programming languages. It is beneficial as it allows developers to interact with databases using
higher-level programming constructs and abstracts away the need for SQL in many cases. It should be used when there is a
clear advantage in terms of development speed and maintainability over using plain SQL.

#### What is the difference between JDBC and JPA? Which are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Give a general overview.

JDBC is a low-level API for executing SQL and handling database connections, while JPA is a higher-level specification
for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects and relational databases. JPA allows for cleaner, more
maintainable code but may introduce overhead and be less performant for certain use cases compared to JDBC.

#### What is Hibernate? What are the advantages, limitations?

Definition:

Hibernate is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java applications. It facilitates the mapping
of an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database, allowing developers to interact with databases
using Java objects rather than SQL. Hibernate implements the Java Persistence API (JPA) specifications.

Advantages:

-Abstraction of Database Specifics:
Hibernate abstracts the application from the underlying SQL database, allowing developers to focus on business logic
without concerning themselves with database-specific details.
-Improved Productivity and Maintainability:
By allowing developers to interact with databases using Java objects, Hibernate speeds up development and enhances code
maintainability and readability.
-Performance Optimization:
Hibernate offers various optimization techniques such as Lazy Loading, Caching, and Batch Processing, to improve the
performance of database access.
-Declarative Transaction Management:
Hibernate provides a declarative transaction management service that can be customized to meet specific requirements.
-Automatic Table Generation:
Hibernate can automatically generate SQL tables based on Java classes, reducing the manual effort required in database
schema creation.
-Scalability:
Hibernate supports a scalable architecture, making it suitable for both small and large enterprise applications.
-Database Independence:
Applications using Hibernate can switch between different databases with minimal changes, promoting database
independence.

Limitations:

-Complexity:
Hibernateâ€™s feature-rich nature and wide array of configurations can be overwhelming and may lead to unnecessary
complexity in simple CRUD applications.
-Learning Curve:
Understanding and mastering Hibernate, including its advanced features and optimizations, can be challenging,
particularly for beginners.
-Performance Overhead:
The abstraction and the additional processing layer introduced by Hibernate can sometimes lead to performance overhead,
particularly for applications with extensive database interactions.
Not Suitable for All Types of Projects:
-While Hibernate is powerful, it may not be the best choice for projects with unique storage requirements, simple
database interactions, or when high-performance, lightweight solutions are needed.
-Debugging:
Debugging Hibernate applications, particularly issues related to SQL generation and transaction management, can be
challenging and time-consuming.

In conclusion, while Hibernate is a powerful ORM tool with many advantages, it has its limitations and may not be
suitable for every project. Careful consideration of the project requirements and constraints is crucial when deciding
whether to use Hibernate.

#### Name 3 different annotations used in JPA, what can they do for you?

In JPA, @Entity is used to mark a class as a persistent entity, @Table specifies the table that the entity is mapped to,
and @Id designates a field as the primary key of the entity. These annotations help in mapping Java objects to database
tables, defining entities and their relationships in the database.

#### What is object-relational impedance mismatch?

Object-relational impedance mismatch arises from the fundamental differences between the object-oriented programming
paradigm and the relational database paradigm. It's the challenge encountered when trying to map objects to relational
databases, due to the differing ways they represent data and relationships.

#### What is a JpaRepository? What are the 2 main methods to define queries in them?

JpaRepository is a JPA specific extension of Repository in Spring Data, providing functionalities like CRUD operations,
pagination, and sorting. Developers can define queries using method names or @Query annotations, allowing for concise
and expressive data access code.

#### Why is the Set preferred over List when we want to store OneToMany relations?

Set is preferred over List in OneToMany relations to avoid redundancy as Set does not allow duplicate elements. Using
Set can prevent issues related to duplicate and unordered data, ensuring data integrity and consistency in
relationships.

#### What kind of inheritance strategies are available? Which annotations are used to solve this?

JPA supports multiple inheritance strategies like SINGLE_TABLE, JOINED, and TABLE_PER_CLASS, configured using the
@Inheritance annotation. These strategies dictate how entities and their subclasses are mapped to the database tables,
providing flexibility in representing object hierarchies in relational databases.

#### Stack and Heap

A szÃ¡mÃ­tÃ³gÃ©pes memÃ³ria kÃ©t fÅ‘ terÃ¼letre oszthatÃ³, amikor programok futtatÃ¡sÃ¡rÃ³l van szÃ³: a heap-re Ã©s a stack-re. MindkÃ©t terÃ¼let kÃ¼lÃ¶nbÃ¶zÅ‘ tÃ­pusÃº adatok tÃ¡rolÃ¡sÃ¡ra szolgÃ¡l, Ã©s kÃ¼lÃ¶nbÃ¶zÅ‘ mÃ³don kezelik az adatok Ã©lettartamÃ¡t. Itt egy gyors Ã¡ttekintÃ©s arrÃ³l, hogy mi tÃ¡rolÃ³dik hol, Ã©s hogyan mÅ±kÃ¶dnek ezek a memÃ³riaterÃ¼letek:

Stack
A stack egy LIFO (Last In, First Out - az utoljÃ¡ra bekerÃ¼lt adat kerÃ¼l ki elÅ‘szÃ¶r) struktÃºrÃ¡jÃº memÃ³riaterÃ¼let, amit a rendszer automatikusan kezel. Az alÃ¡bbi adatokat tÃ¡rolja:

PrimitÃ­v tÃ­pusÃº vÃ¡ltozÃ³k Ã©rtÃ©kei: Mint pÃ©ldÃ¡ul int, char, short, stb., amikor ezek lokÃ¡lis vÃ¡ltozÃ³k egy fÃ¼ggvÃ©nyben vagy eljÃ¡rÃ¡sban.
Referencia/vÃ¡ltozÃ³ cÃ­mek: Amikor egy objektumot vagy tÃ¶mbÃ¶t lÃ©trehozol a heap-en, a referencia (vagy pointer) az objektumra/tÃ¶mbre a stack-en lesz tÃ¡rolva.
FÃ¼ggvÃ©nyhÃ­vÃ¡sok Ã©s visszatÃ©rÃ©si cÃ­mek: Amikor egy fÃ¼ggvÃ©nyt vagy metÃ³dust meghÃ­vsz, a stack tÃ¡rolja a hÃ­vÃ¡s kontextusÃ¡t, beleÃ©rtve a paramÃ©tereket, a lokÃ¡lis vÃ¡ltozÃ³kat Ã©s a fÃ¼ggvÃ©nybÅ‘l valÃ³ visszatÃ©rÃ©s cÃ­mÃ©t.
A stack memÃ³ria nagyon gyors, de korlÃ¡tozott mÃ©retÅ±. A stack-en lÃ©vÅ‘ adatok Ã©lettartama korlÃ¡tozott; egy fÃ¼ggvÃ©ny vagy eljÃ¡rÃ¡s befejezÃ©sekor automatikusan felszabadulnak.

Heap
A heap egy szabadon kezelt memÃ³riaterÃ¼let, ahol a dinamikus memÃ³ria-allokÃ¡ciÃ³ tÃ¶rtÃ©nik. Itt tÃ¡rolÃ³dnak:

Objektumok Ã©s tÃ¶mbÃ¶k: Amikor a program futÃ¡sa sorÃ¡n objektumokat Ã©s tÃ¶mbÃ¶ket hozol lÃ©tre (pÃ©ldÃ¡ul a new kulcsszÃ³ hasznÃ¡latÃ¡val Java-ban vagy a malloc C-ben), ezek a heap-en lesznek tÃ¡rolva.
Dinamikusan allokÃ¡lt adatok: BÃ¡rmely adat, amit explicit mÃ³don a programozÃ³ hoz lÃ©tre dinamikusan, a heap-en kerÃ¼l tÃ¡rolÃ¡sra.
A heap-en tÃ¡rolt adatok Ã©lettartama nem korlÃ¡tozÃ³dik a deklarÃ¡ciÃ³juk kontextusÃ¡ra; ezek az adatok addig maradnak Ã©rvÃ©nyben, amÃ­g explicit mÃ³don felszabadÃ­tÃ¡sra nem kerÃ¼lnek (pÃ©ldÃ¡ul a delete kulcsszÃ³val C++-ban vagy a garbage collector Ã¡ltal Java-ban Ã©s mÃ¡s magas szintÅ± nyelveken). A heap memÃ³ria kezelÃ©se lassabb, mint a stack-Ã©, mivel a memÃ³riaalokÃ¡ciÃ³ Ã©s felszabadÃ­tÃ¡s dinamikus Ã©s kevÃ©sbÃ© hatÃ©kony.

Ã–sszegzÃ©s
Stack: Gyors, automatikusan kezelt, LIFO memÃ³riaterÃ¼let lokÃ¡lis vÃ¡ltozÃ³k Ã©s fÃ¼ggvÃ©nyhÃ­vÃ¡sok szÃ¡mÃ¡ra. KorlÃ¡tozott mÃ©retÅ± Ã©s scope-ban (hatÃ³kÃ¶rben).
Heap: Nagyobb, flexibilisebb memÃ³riaterÃ¼let a dinamikusan allokÃ¡lt adatok szÃ¡mÃ¡ra. Lassabb hozzÃ¡fÃ©rÃ©s, Ã©s explicit memÃ³riakezelÃ©st igÃ©nyel (vagy garbage collection-t hasznÃ¡lÃ³ nyelvek esetÃ©n automatikus felszabadÃ­tÃ¡st).
Ezek a memÃ³riaterÃ¼letek kritikus szerepet jÃ¡tszanak a modern szoftverfejlesztÃ©sben, mivel lehetÅ‘vÃ© teszik a hatÃ©kony Ã©s rugalmas adatkezelÃ©st a programokban.
